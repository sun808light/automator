# Automator - App That Works For You
```
The modern technology solutions are diverse and work at different levels making it difficult for the 
users to link their applications to work synchronously. Individual applications are a great feature in 
itself but integration of various applications and services can lead to increased productivity. 
Integration will save time on users part to perform simple functionalities. 
```
```
Our project is an Android application which aims to connect applications and  create an unique workflow. 
It’s main purpose is to interlink applications and reduce the users work. Automator’s primary task will be 
to interconnect basic applications like SMS service, Wi-Fi service, Location service etc. (phone functionalities) 
with each other in order to simplify users work. It will create a workflow that will automate everyday
functions for the user. It will also provide features for individual and device safety.
This project was inspired by the app IFTTT.
