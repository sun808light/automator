Individual applications are a great feature in itself but integration of various applications and services can lead to increased productivity. Integration will save time on users part to perform simple functionalities.

Our project is an Android application which aims to connect applications and  create an unique workflow. It’s main purpose is to interlink applications and reduce the users work. Automator’s primary task will be to interconnect basic applications like SMS service, Wi-Fi service , Location service etc. (basic phone functionalities) with each other in order to simplify users work. It will create a workflow that will automate everyday functions for the user. It will also provide features for individual and device safety.  This project was inspired by the app IFTTT.
